# Top Trumps Pokemon

This is my final group project for the CFG Python kickstarter course.

It is a game of Top Trumps, using the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/), where you play against the computer.

You and your opponent will randomly draw a Pokemon card. A stat is chosen, and the player with the highest stat wins the round.

A maximum of 10 rounds can be played, with you and the computer taking turns to select the stat.
